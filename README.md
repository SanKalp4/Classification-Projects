# DS-Classification-Project

Problem Statement : The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a bank. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Business Goal : The classification goal is to predict if the client/customer will subscribe (yes/no) in a bank deposit.
